<p style color="red">The journey of Dr. Zulekha Daud, Founder and Chairperson, Zulekha Healthcare Group, has been truly inspirational

There is compassion or perhaps a mantra in Dr. Zulekha’s brand of care, which has benefitted innumerous patrons for the last five decades, leaving a lasting impact in the region. In her own words, “Beyond the technology, besides the specialists, there is something more – the magic of a caring touch.” It is that charisma and quality, which makes people fondly call her as 'Mama Zulekha'. The Group has now reached the zenith of excellence in healthcare, thanks largely to Dr. Zulekha’s strong ethic of compassion.
The journey started in the early 1960's when Dr. Zulekha Daud came to the UAE after completing her medical degree from the Government Medical College in Nagpur, India. It was her father, Sadiq Vali, who advised her to go to the Gulf. Choosing the UAE over a lucrative career in the UK, she helped people in deep need of medical treatment. During those days the UAE was a vast expanse of desert without any electricity; medical facilities were rudimentary to say the least. But despite unfavorable conditions Dr. Zulekha decided to stay on and serve the people with a rare display of selflessness. Since there were no hospitals in those days, she travelled door-to-door to attend to normal deliveries. With her dedicated service, she was able to capture the hearts of the nationals and expatriates alike. In her own words, "What I did was nothing greater than the need for medical attention. I borrowed strength from the overwhelming need of the people in this country."
